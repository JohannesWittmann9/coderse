For the current _Release_-Version of coderse, please navigate to: [coderse](https://coderse.software-engineering.education)

Coderse is a web-app, to share complex code-files commented by audio data. Mark lines in your code by dragging the cursor and 
explain those with your voice messages. Create a Code-Cast and share it. Receivers do not actually need an account to open
the generated link, so start sharing code!
